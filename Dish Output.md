Dish Output

The dish should taste like we are so used to taste on the street or at the sweet shop. Because we are in lockdown, we cannot enjoy the taste of our favourite dishes like samosa. So, I hope you like the recipe and you have got what you wanted for a long time. I hope your samosa tastes great and I garantee that it will because of your hard work and efforts for making this recipe, first i would like to thank you for supporting me as I don't know the recipes very well, so I chose to look up at the internet, which is cheating but i am new to begin with. So I would like to thank the internet because without ot, i wouldn't have serached such a cool recipe like a samosa. Last but not the least, I would to thank the site called asknestle.in.
